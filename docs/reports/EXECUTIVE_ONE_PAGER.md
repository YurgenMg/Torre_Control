## Supply Chain Intelligence Report - DataCo Global

**Report Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Classification:** Internal - Executive Leadership  
**Prepared by:** Data Engineering Team

---

## 🔴 THE SITUATION: OPERATIONAL BLINDNESS COSTS $21.7M

**Core Problem:** Our supply chain visibility is broken. We ship 186,638 orders monthly across 5 continents and have **no idea which ones will be late until it's too late.**

### The Numbers Don't Lie

| Metric | Current State | Target | Gap |
|--------|--------------|--------|-----|
| **On-Time In-Full (OTIF)** | **40.86%** | 90%+ | -49.14% ❌ |
| **Revenue at Risk** | **$21.7M** (57% of revenue) | <$5M | +$16.7M ⚠️ |
| **Late Deliveries** | 106,927/186,638 | <50K | +56,927 🚨 |
| **VIP Customers in Churn Risk** | **3,658 customers** | <500 | +3,158 💀 |

**Translation:** For every $100 we make, $57 ships late. We're hemorrhaging revenue and customers.

### LEVER 3: The Geographic Uniformity (Hidden Insight)

**Finding:** ALL 5 markets have ~57% late delivery rate. This is NOT a regional problem—it's a global procurement problem.

| Market | Orders | Late Rate | Revenue at Risk | Implication |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 🇪🇺 Europe | 50,252 | 57.69% | $6.2M | Problem is global, not Europe-specific |
| 🌎 LATAM | 51,594 | 57.02% | $5.8M | Problem is global, not LATAM-specific |
| 🌏 Pacific | 41,260 | 57.32% | $4.7M | Problem is global, not Pacific-specific |
| 🇺🇸 USCA | 31,918 | 57.24% | $3.5M | Problem is global, not USCA-specific |
| 🌍 Africa | 11,614 | 56.81% | $1.2M | Problem is global, not Africa-specific |

**Action Required:**
- Do NOT close/consolidate regional distribution centers
- DO fix the 7 problematic products (applies everywhere)
- **Expected Impact:** Fix Pareto 80/20 = improve ALL regions simultaneously

## 🎯 FINANCIAL IMPACT SUMMARY

### If We Fix the 7 Products:
```
Current:  OTIF 40.86% → On-Time Delivery = 40% revenue confidence
Target:   OTIF 55%    → On-Time Delivery = 55% revenue confidence
Gain:     +$10M revenue protection
Retain:   1,000+ VIP customers (lifetime value: ~$150M)
```

### Conservative Case (Fix 3 Products)
```
Improvement: +5% OTIF = 40.86% → 45%
Revenue Protected: +$3M
```

### Upside Case (Fix All 7 + VIP Retention)
```
Improvement: +15% OTIF = 40.86% → 56%
Revenue Protected: +$15M
Customer Retention: +3,658 VIPs at risk
```
